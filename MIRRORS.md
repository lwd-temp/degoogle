# Degoogle Mirrors

If you host a mirror, let me know through an Issue or PR so it can be added to the community mirrors list. It would be prefered if your mirror is auto-updating.

Official mirrors are the main sources and are maintained by me (@tycrek). Community mirrors are other Git instances run by other users that I can't control.
